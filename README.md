ADVICES FOR USERS :
- You need Unity 2018
- You'll a paid addon on asset store : Amplify (i put gitignore for theses files). All shaders are made with it.
- And some package available for free on asset store :
  - Raw Mocap Data (used for some simple animations demos)
  - TextMesh Pro (used for some cool text on screen)
  - Recorder (used to make gif/vids from scene)


Thanks to Keijiro for inspiration

Have fun
