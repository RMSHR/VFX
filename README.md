VFX experimentations with shaders in Unity

Visuals on Instamgram : https://www.instagram.com/remy.sohier/
Also some on Twitter : @sohierremy

ADVICES FOR USERS :
- You need  Unity 2018
- And an Amplify version (i put gitignore for theses files). All shaders are made with it.

Thanks to Keijiro for inspiration

Have fun
